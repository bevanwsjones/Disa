\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Represents a subgraph G\textquotesingle{} that is a subset of a parent adjacency graph G. 

The Adjacency Subgraph class is used to represent a subgraph that is a subset of some parent adjacency graph. It therefore functions similarly to a graph, but also stores additional data which describes the further relationships with the parent graph. This includes a hash of the parent graph to ensure its integrity of certain operations, a local-\/to-\/global map to map between the local subgraph and global graph vertex indices, and the level of each vertex in the sub graph.

Levels in this context refers to \textquotesingle{}level traversal\textquotesingle{}, which forms a \textquotesingle{}halo\textquotesingle{} like topological structure around the primary partition. This allows the subgraph to store overlapping (with other subgraphs) vertices. All vertices in the primary partition will have a level value of 0, and each successive level will increase by 1. While non-\/zero level nodes are stored stored in the data structure they are not considered \textquotesingle{}local\textquotesingle{} to the subgraph, as this is reserved for the primary partition. There is however no constraints placed ordering of vertex indices and their level value, as such vertex 0 may have a non-\/zero level.

\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The relationship between the parent graph and the subgraph is logical, and not enforced. Any update to the topology of the parent or subgraph will invalidate their correlation.
\item Some edge and vertex operations may produce different results in the subgraph compared to the parent graph. For example, checking the degree of a peripheral vertex in the subgraph will most likely give a different value than checking the same vertex in the parent graph. Similarly, the \char`\"{}contains\char`\"{} method may give different results since it uses edge data.

Future\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Add iterators (e.\+g., begin(), end()).
\item Create arithmetic operators (+, -\/, etc.) for unions and intersections.
\item Consider creating a base graph class from which this class can inherit.
